# Coffee-Machine
Project from the Jetbrains course
The program emulates a coffee machine. You can buy coffee of your choice, find out how many resources are left, refuel the coffee machine and collect money from the coffee machine.
Each step of the program execution is displayed in the console. This program is one of many at the Jetbrains course.
